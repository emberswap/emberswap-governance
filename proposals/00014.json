    "content": "1. PROPOSAL DETAILS\n\n Add boosted farms monthly with the new allocations. A new option for important decisions will be added too. Important decissions will need above 85% (based on previous proposals) of approval to pass. The first important decission added will be instant boost farms, that wont wait to monthly allocation but will require a 84% approval. These proposals can be a 3 option proposal so if instant approval is not over 85% but it is approved then it will be added to the monthly boosted farms. \n\n &nbsp; \n\n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT - Investors will have stability in the farms, encouraging liquidity providers to participate in the ecosystem. \n\n &nbsp; \n\n3. IMPACT ON USERS - More waiting time in the desired farms. \n\n &nbsp; \n\n4. EXPECTED POSITIVE IMPACT - More stability in the farms will help investors and liquidity providers to make choices and to step into the ecosystem. \n\n&nbsp; \n\n5. KNOWN POTENTIAL OR NEGATIVE DOWNSIDES - Farms wont be inmediatily added to the boosted ones, providing a timeframe where emberswap wont be so agile adopting new project opportunities.",
