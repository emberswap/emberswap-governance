Since https://apes.cash/ is a new project and seems to have a lot of value (10.000 nfts with floor price about 0.10bch its 1.000 BCH).\n\n&nbsp; \n\nEconomic impact\n\nIf we give a farm to Banana token we will be the first farm for this token which means we have a chance to generate an increased number of transactions that will result in more fees being paid and an increasing treasury. This would mean loss of about $800 liquidity of GOB boosted farm removal.",
